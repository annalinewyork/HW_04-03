Sick Babies And Dehydration
It sounds like your baby is having a bad cold or other virus infection. If he has a cold, it will last about 7-14 days.
If he has a stuffy nose and/or a fever, he will not eat much. To help your baby with his stopped up nose, you can use saline nose drops. You make these by adding 0.5 teaspoon of table salt to 2 cups of boiled water. After the solution has come to room temperature, put one drop in each nostril then suck gently with the 1 ounce rubber syringe (suction bulb). Do this before each feeding and at bed time to make it easier for the child to breathe.
Also keep offering him fluids as much as possible. It is very important that he doesnâ€™t get dehydrated. If he continues to refuse to drink and starts showing signs of dehydration (specified below), you need to take him to a doctor immediately.
To help his sore throat and fever, you can give him Baby Tylenol and see if it helps.
If it seems to you like your baby is getting worse, not better, you should also take him to a doctor. If for example the fever is getting higher, it might mean that he has a bacterial infection and needs antibiotics. With a cold that has already lasted for 5 days, he should soon be getting better.
